# MY PATIENT HEALTHCARE SYSTEM


## PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. There is a dearth of a healthcare platform that is centralised for vaccinations, organ and blood donations.
2. Due to unavailability of online applications, the different enterprises such as healthcare, emergency units, supply chain, organ and blood donation banks find it difficult to cordinate and work simultaneously.
3. This leads to creation of hindrances when patient is in need of vaccines, organ transplants or blood.

## SOLUTION
1. We have built an application which will solve the issue of integration between the enterprises.
2. Using our application, the patients need not worry about the logistics, formalities once they request for blood, vaccines or the organ transplant.
3. We have got together a platform where all the healthcare professionals, ambulances, donors, pharmacists, suppliers get together, there by making the process of connecting easier and efficient.
